    "# The Caesar Cipher\n",
    "\n",
    "In this cipher, we have the notion of an \"alphabet\", which is the set of symbols that can be used to write down the plain and cipher texts. For example, the alphabet could consist of only lowercase letters in the English alphabet (26 symbols), upper and lowercase (52 symbols), or upper, lower and numbers (62 symbols). During encryption, each symbol in the plaintext will be replaced by another symbol in the same alphabet. The mapping between symbols thus forms the \"key\". While this key can be represented in binary, we shall not do so at this time to avoid confusion. Let's generate the key using Python, assume that the alphabet consists of lowercase letters only:"
